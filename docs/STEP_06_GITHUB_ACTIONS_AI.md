# Step 06 – GitHub Actions & AI-Powered Testing

## 🎯 What You Will Learn

- How **GitHub Actions** workflows work (YAML syntax)
- How to use an **LLM (GPT-4o)** for automated PR code review
- **SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)** principles: automation, reliability, observability
- How AI models fit into modern software engineering pipelines

## 📚 Concept: What is CI/CD?

**CI** = Continuous Integration  
**CD** = Continuous Delivery / Deployment

```
Developer pushes code
        ↓
   GitHub Actions triggers automatically
        ↓
   ┌─────────────────────────────────┐
   │  Job 1: Build TypeScript        │ ← Catch compile errors early
   │  Job 2: Run API Tests           │ ← Verify endpoints work
   │  Job 3: Run E2E Tests           │ ← Verify full user flow
   │  Job 4: Run BDD Tests           │ ← Verify business requirements
   └─────────────────────────────────┘
        ↓
   All green? ✅ → Code is safe to merge
   Any red?   ❌ → Block the merge, notify the developer
```

**Why it matters:** In a team of 10 developers, CI/CD ensures that code pushed by one person doesn't break another person's feature. It's the safety net of modern software delivery.

## 📚 Concept: GitHub Actions YAML Anatomy

```yaml
name: CI – Build, Lint & Test    # Name shown in GitHub UI

on:                              # TRIGGERS — when does this run?
  push:
    branches: [main]             # On push to main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]             # On PRs targeting main

jobs:                            # JOBS — what to do (run in parallel by default)
  build:
    name: Build TypeScript
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest       # Which OS (GitHub provides this for free!)

    steps:                       # STEPS — sequential commands within a job
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4   # "uses" = a pre-built action from the marketplace

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "20"     # "with" = parameters for the action

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci              # "run" = a shell command
        working-directory: backend  # Where to run it
```

**Key concepts:**
- **`on`**: The trigger (push, PR, schedule, manual)
- **`jobs`**: Run in parallel unless you use `needs:` to create dependencies
- **`steps`**: Run sequentially within a job
- **`uses`**: Reuse pre-built actions (like npm packages, but for CI)
- **`run`**: Execute any shell command

---

## 📚 Concept: Job Dependencies

```yaml
jobs:
  build:        # ← Runs first (no dependencies)
    ...

  api-tests:
    needs: build   # ← Only runs IF build succeeds
    ...

  e2e-tests:
    needs: build   # ← Also runs in parallel with api-tests
    ...
```

This creates a pipeline:
```
build ──→ api-tests ─┐
      └──→ e2e-tests ─┤
          └──→ bdd-tests ┘
```

---

## 📚 Concept: Secrets — Keeping API Keys Safe

```yaml
# In the workflow:
env:
  OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

```
Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret
Name: OPENAI_API_KEY
Value: sk-...your-key...
```

**Why secrets?** Never put API keys in code. If they end up in Git history, anyone can find them forever. GitHub Secrets are encrypted and never appear in logs.

---

## 📚 Concept: AI-Powered PR Review

The `ai-pr-review.yml` workflow:
1. Triggers on every new PR or push to a PR
2. Gets the diff of changed files (what changed in this PR)
3. Sends the diff to **GPT-4o** with a system prompt that says "you are a TypeScript expert"
4. GPT-4o returns a structured code review
5. The script posts the review as a comment on the GitHub PR

```python
# scripts/ai_pr_review.py (simplified)
diff = get_git_diff()  # What changed in this PR

review = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a TypeScript + QA expert. Review this PR diff..."},
        {"role": "user", "content": f"Review:\n{diff}"}
    ]
)

post_github_comment(review.choices[0].message.content)
```

**This is a real pattern used in production** at companies like GitHub (Copilot for PRs), Linear, and many others.

## 📚 Concept: SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)

SRE is a discipline that applies software engineering principles to operations. Key concepts:

| SRE Concept | How This Project Demonstrates It |
|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **Automation** | GitHub Actions runs tests automatically — humans don't manually verify each commit |
| **Reliability** | Tests catch regressions before they reach users |
| **Observability** | Health check endpoint (`GET /health`), test reports, CI status badges |
| **Error Budgets** | The `retries: 2` in Playwright allows 2 flaky test failures before failing the build |
| **Toil Reduction** | AI PR review reduces manual code review burden |

---

## 🚀 Set Up GitHub Actions Locally

You can run GitHub Actions workflows locally using [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act):

```bash
# Install act (macOS)
brew install act

# Run the CI workflow locally
act push

# Run just the build job
act push -j build
```

---

## 🔧 Adding a Status Badge to Your README

Once CI is passing, add this to your README:

```markdown
[![CI](https://github.com/rayme11/full-stack-agentic-testing/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/rayme11/full-stack-agentic-testing/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
```

This shows a green/red badge that anyone can see — instant visibility into the health of the codebase.

## 📝 Try This Yourself

### Exercise 1: Add a scheduled workflow
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1-5"   # Every weekday at 9 AM UTC
```
This runs your tests every morning before your team starts work. Morning failures = something broke overnight.

### Exercise 2: Add a lint step
Add ESLint to the CI pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Lint TypeScript
  run: npm run lint
  working-directory: backend
```
Now any ESLint rule violation blocks the merge.

### Exercise 3: Upload test reports as artifacts
The CI already does this! After a test run, go to the GitHub Actions run page → click "Artifacts" → download the HTML report and open it in your browser.

### Exercise 4: Intentionally break something
1. Change a 201 to a 200 in `routes/ideas.ts`
2. Push to a branch and open a PR
3. Watch GitHub Actions turn red
4. Watch the AI review comment point out the issue
5. Fix it and watch everything go green

This is the full CI/CD feedback loop in action!
